My Data Analytics Portofolio 2022


# Introduction

This case study is my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate.
It involves analysis of historical data for a fictional company, cyclistic, a bike sharing company located in Chicago, to make recommendations for an upcoming marketing campaign. Although the company and scenario are fictitious, the data used for this project are real data collected between August 2020 and March 2022 from a bike share program in Chicago. In this project, I am assuming the role of the junior analyst.
Cyclistic is a fictional bike sharing company located in Chicago. It operates a fleet of more than 5,800 bicycles which can be accessed from over 600 docking stations across the city. Bikes can be borrowed from on docking station, ridden, then returned to any docking station in the system. Over the years, marketing campagins have been broad and targeted a cross-section of potential users. Data analysis has shown that riders with an annual membership are more profitable than casual riders. The marketing team are interested in creating a campaign to encourage casual riders to convert to members.
The marketing analyst team would like to know how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how Cyclistic can use digital media to influence caual riders to become members. The team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends in the usage of bikes by casual and member riders.
